my objects and arrays might look something like this

{
  userData: {
    name: "Cate",
    grandtotal: 24,
    days: [
      {
        day: 1,
        nutrition: "5",
        workout: 1,
        stretch: 0, // just true / false, or the points?
        supp: 1,
        water: 1,
        other: 1,
        comments: 1,
        commenttext: "that was easy",
        dailytotal: 11,
      },
      {
        day: 2,
        nutrition: "5",
        workout: 1,
        stretch: 1, 
        supp: 1,
        water: 1,
        other: 1,
        comments: 1,
        commenttext: "that was hard",
        dailytotal: 13,
      }
    ]
  }
}


to make things more DRY
function updateScoreboard
target and value

MVC - model view controller
firebase

similar to chat client homework in a way
usernames 

start by hardcoding username - always Cate
on submit
gather data
display data (view part)
save data

calculate grandTotal on the fly each time
add a row each time there is data
